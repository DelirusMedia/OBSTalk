# OBSTalk
A small interface for Arduino and Python, to build your own "Stream-Deck"

First of all, this tool is on it's very early stage and I'm not a skilled coder at all, but I'm trying to improve my
skills and this tool whenever I can!


This small tool enables you, to connect you Arduino with you Open Broadcaster and control it via Websocket.

To-Do list:
  - Dynamically searching for open Arduino-Serialport instead of "being static" (or at least a drop-down menu, where you can choose your 
  COM-Port)
  
  - Create a dynamic configuration for each and every button/slider/control knob
 
  - Improve the user-gui
  
  - Polishing the code
